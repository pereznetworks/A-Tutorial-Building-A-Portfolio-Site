      Step 1B: QA Front-end Projects

          All Projects QA checked and all shined up for display

    Step 2: have screen shots for all front-end Projects 1 - 5

      and a widescreen full imgs to show each site's various pages
      not featuring Project 6, as it has no front-end

    Step 3: create json data for projects and profile
            require in app.js
            access data in pug templates

    Step 4: routes

      static routes, index and about

      dynamic routes for project pages

      error handling

    Step 5: find a way to include use of node.js path module

    STEP 6: verify rendering for static, index and about,
      as well as dynamic routes, for project Pages

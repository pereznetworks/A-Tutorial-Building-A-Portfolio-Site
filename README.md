    built as part of Full Stack Java Script, Team TreeHouse Tech Degree  

    this site is built using Node.js, Express Framework,
    and Pug for html template rendering


# Featuring Projects 1 thru 6

    Step 1A: make sure we have a live link for each "front-end" project

      Project 1 : Random Qoutes Generator
          Live Link:  https://pereznetworks.github.io/TechDegree-Project1/
          GitHub : https://github.com/pereznetworks/TechDegree-Project1

      Project 2 : Pagination and Content Filtering
          Live Link:  https://pereznetworks.github.io/TechDegree-Project2/
          GitHub : https://github.com/pereznetworks/TechDegree-Project2

      Project 3 : An Interactive Form
          Live Link:  https://pereznetworks.github.io/TD-Project3/
          GitHub : https://github.com/pereznetworks/TD-Project3

      Project 4 : Tic Tac Toe
          Live Link:  https://pereznetworks.github.io/TD-Project4/
          GitHub : https://github.com/pereznetworks/TD-Project4

      Project 5 : Employee Directory
          Live Link:  https://pereznetworks.github.io/TD-Project5/
          GitHub : https://github.com/pereznetworks/TD-Project5

    Step 1B:

      what to do for project 6, which is command line node.js app
        so we'll have to think about how to demo this live, online..

      Project 6 : Build a Content Scraper for a shopping site
          Live Link:  ??
          GitHub : https://github.com/pereznetworks/TD-Project6

    Step 2: get screen shots for each ....

      need a thumbnail, sqaure img
      and a widescreen full imgs to show each site's various pages
